# TradeBar

Coming from a C# background I am using this as a sample application to learn the basics of NodeJS and React along with Lightning payment concepts.

The goal is to keep it simple:
Load up some products, create a cart of items and checkout. Generate a lightning invoice, pay and complete transaction

Would be nice to add auth, user creation and channel maintenance along with a proper mongodb backend.

For the lightning network setup, I highly recommend downloading Polar which will take the pain of setting up a Lighning network atop of a BTC Node - so helpful.
